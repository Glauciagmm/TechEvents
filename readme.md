Hi there!

We are: Carol, Patri, Glaucia, Jesús, Martí and Pablo; a group of enthusiastic coders excited about web-designing. On our latest project we have created a web-page for an online web-developing academy.

Our goal is to offer a flexible and dynamic learning environment for our customers, whether they are teachers or students.

On this page, we provide several functionalities based on the role of the customer. 

If the teacher logs in to the platform, he could set a maximum number for students on each class and also set the date for which class will take place.

On the other hand, the student can register and log himself in the webpage, while also register and un-register himself from courses.

The tools used for this project were:

- Trello

- Figma

- IntelliJ Idea

- PHP MySQL

- Thymeleaf

- Heroku
