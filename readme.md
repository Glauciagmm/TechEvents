# TechEvents üöÄ

This is our event management app. Admins can add/remove/edit events and users can subscribe/unsubscribe to attend them.

## How It's Made:
---

**Tech used üõ†Ô∏è:** Java, Spring, Thymeleaf, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Bootstrap, MariaDB

With Springboot to power our fullstack app, we made a responsive and modern looking system to manage events.

Our goal is to offer a flexible and dynamic learning environment for our customers, whether they are teachers or students.

This was our first time doing a fullstack app with Java and we managed to deliver in a short time.

## Optimizations
---

In order to deliver on time, we had to use javascript to do some little features such as the days/hours left or not allow to sign up if the even expired.

## Lessons Learned:
---

Springboot makes things much simpler and helps a lot.

We like thymeleaf! It's very powerfull and allows us to do a lot of cool stuff.
